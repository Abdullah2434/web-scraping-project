Upvote if someone has redrawn an AI comic with their own hands, if you like it, even if it looks like an five-year-old's drawing. Or just go back to editing real comics, even if they're bigoted, at least it's not hard to look at. I don't want to see AI slop with piss filter in my feed, and I barely see Stonetoss comics here. Original content and comics are also great. #MakeStontossingjuiceGreatAgain ",
